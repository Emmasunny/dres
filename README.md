Today's plus size women aren't starved for choice the way they were at one time. They don't have to accept whatever unattractive baglike dress (with prints from another era) that the clothing makers choose to put out, with no imagination contributing to the process. And just as clothing labels are discovering the joys of designing for the voluptuous woman in the everyday clothing market, so are the makers of wedding-related clothing discovering the full-bodied woman.
